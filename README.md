## PyExotel

Welcome to PyExotel, an unofficial Python package for interacting with Exotel's API. With PyExotel, you can easily make phone calls, manage campaigns, and gather information about calls and phone numbers using your Exotel API credentials.

## Installation

To install pyexotel, use `pip`:

```python
pip install pyexotel
```

## Exotel Class - Call Methods

To use PyExotel, you will first need to create an instance of the Exotel class with your Exotel API key, API secret, SID, and domain. You can find these credentials in the Exotel Dashboard.

```python
from pyexotel import Exotel

dialer = Exotel(api_key="exotel_api_key", api_secret="exotel_api_secret", sid='exotel_sid', domain="exotel_domain", ccm_domain="exotel_ccm_domain")
```
**Parameters**
* api_key (str): Your Exotel `API key`.
* api_secret (str): Your Exotel `API secret`.
* sid (str): Your Exotel `SID`.
* domain (str): Exotel APi Domain ( Singapore cluster is `api.exotel.com` (default) & Mumbai cluster is api.in.exotel.com)
* ccm_domain(str): Exotel CCM Api Domain ( Singapore cluster is `ccm-api.exotel.com` & Mumbai cluster is `ccm-api.in.exotel.com` (Default))


For `Exotel` instance, you can now use the various methods available to interact with the Exotel API. Some things you can do include:

### Place a Call

To place a call from one phone number (agent\_number) to another (customer\_number), use the call method:

```python
response = dialer.call(agent_number="NumberA", customer_number="numberB", caller_id="exotel_callerID")
```

### Connect a Call to a Flow

To connect a call from a customer (`customer_number`) to a specific flow (or applet) using Exotel's API, use the `connect_flow` method:

```python
response = dialer.connect_flow(customer_number, called_id, flow_id)
```

### Get Call Information

To get information about a call, such as its timing and recording URL, use the `get_call_info` method:

```python
exotel.get_call_info(call_sid="call_sid")
```

### Get Phone Information

To get information about a phone number, such as its operator name and DND status, use the `get_phone_info` method:

```python
response = dialer.get_phone_info(phone_number)
```

Each of these methods returns a JSON object containing the response from the Exotel server.
